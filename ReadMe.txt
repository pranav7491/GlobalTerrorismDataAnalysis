Global Terrorism Data Analysis :-

I recently worked on global terrorism Data set and, I analyzed it using various R programming techniques. R gives the flexibility of using treemap, 
leaflet, histogram and graphs. I have done Text Analysis on ransom note attribute given in the data set to create a word cloud of related words 
and frequently occuring words. I have also created dendrogram to cluster similar words or the words which come often in pair. 

While displaying people killed, I have made sure I also display people getting injured. The size of boxes is proportional to number of people 
killed in that year, in a country and, darkness of color represents people injured.

I also performed chi-square test for target types in United states for success and failure, I got a chi-square test value of 55.497. This means 
target types in USA and success of attack are related to each other.
If we understand what areas and time periods terrorists target, we can save innocent lives.
