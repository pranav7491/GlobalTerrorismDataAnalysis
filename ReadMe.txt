Global Terrorism Data Analysis :-

I recently worked on global terrorism Data set and, I analyzed it using various R programming techniques. R gives the flexibility of using treemap, leaflet, histogram and graphs. I have done Text Analysis on ransom note attribute given in the data set to create a word cloud of related words and frequently occuring words. I have also created dendrogram to cluster similar words or the words which come often in pair.
